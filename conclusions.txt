Technical Conclusions
-In order to start the work we defined the metrics we were going to use, and what we were going to model (objects list).
-Defining the layout for the complete scene proved to be useful. Thanks to this we obtained metrics and structured a plan.
-Splitting the work and having an online cooperative tool for the project helped with managing files and versions.
Having everyone work individually in their tasks instead of everyone working in the same one helped to finish the project faster.
-When looking for external objects to import, we needed to make sure the objects were compatible with blender.
-Working with imported objects without texture was difficult because we needed to add them by ourselves.
-Changing textures from being in Blender Render to Cycles Render was time consuming.
-Saving constantly was a must at the end of the project since Blender crashes very often when dealing with many objects.


Ethical Conclusions
Discuss how your project relates to our responsibilities as a professionals
If you wish, discuss how you project relates to human morality

Ethical Conclusions
-This project can be related to our responsabilities as professionals specifically in project management. It involves 
a project in which many people have to work cooperatively. Another thing to consider are the requirements set 
by the client (teacher) and the tasks. These tasks are necessary to have a plan and a clear division of work.
-Our project can be related to a specific point of view of morality, this point being, treating living creatures with respect.
Believing that every living creature has feelings implies that we should respect them regardless of the creature (animals/pokemon).
The project we modeled depicts a pokemon center, which is basically a hospital for pokemon. These are living creatures in 
the environment we are setting, they cooperate with people and are treated with respect.
